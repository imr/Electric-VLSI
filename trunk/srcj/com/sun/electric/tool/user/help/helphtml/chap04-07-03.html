<!-- HEADER 4-7-3: Aligning to Objects -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Horizontally to Left -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Horizontally to Right -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Horizontally to Center -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Vertically to Top -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Vertically to Bottom -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Move/Align Vertically to Center -->

It is often the case that a collection of objects should line-up uniformly.
The commands of the <B>Edit / Move</B> menu offer six possible ways to do this.
<P>
The command <B>Align Horizontally to Left</B> (and <B>Align Horizontally to Right</B>)
moves all of the selected objects so that their left edge (or right edge) is moved to the leftmost (or rightmost)
edge of those objects.
The command <B>Align Horizontally to Center</B> moves all of the selected objects so that their X center
is at the location of the X center coordinate of those objects.
<P>
The command <B>Align Vertically to Top</B> (and <B>Align Vertically to Bottom</B>)
moves all of the selected objects so that their top edge (or bottom edge) is moved to the topmost (or bottommost)
edge of those objects.
The command <B>Align Vertically to Center</B> moves all of the selected objects so that their Y center
is at the location of the Y center coordinate of those objects.
