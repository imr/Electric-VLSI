<!-- HEADER 9-10-1: Parasitic Extraction -->

<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Parasitic -->
<!-- PROJECTSETTING Parasitic -->

<P>
Parasitic Extraction is used by netlisters and other parts of the system that need to know
about geometric factors.
Control of parasitic extraction is done with the Parasitic Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Parasitic" tab) and the Parasitic Project Settings
(in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "Parasitic" tab).
For the difference between Preferences and Project Settings, see
<A HREF="chap06-03.html#chap06-03">Section 6-3</A>.

Each layer of every technology is listed, and you can set its unit resistance,
area capacitance, and edge capacitance.
The "Factory Reset" buttons reverts values to the default shipped with Electric.
<P>
The bottom section controls values for every layer in a technology.
You can set the minimum resistance and capacitance, as well as the maximum series resistance.
The maximum series resistance breaks long single PI models into series of distributed PI models.
"Include Gate In Resistance" requests that a transistor's gate area be included in overall
area calculations for resistance determination.
"Include Ground Network" requests that ground networks be analyzed.
The "Gate Length Shrink" is a compensation factor for gate lengths.
Some process technologies shrink the gate length by a fixed amount.

This dialog offers more controls:
<UL>
<LI>"Use Verbose Naming"
The parasitic extractor inserts resistors,
and thus makes multiple networks out of a single network.
The new networks are automatically named by the netlister.
Normally, the names are simple, such as "oldnetworkname#1".
When verbose naming is requested, the network names include the nodes to which they connect,
for example "oldnetworkname#m1m2conn-conn@0".
This makes it possible for the user to cross-probe back to the layout from
the expanded Spice file, but it makes the file larger.</LI>
<LI>"Back Annotate Layout"
transfers schematic net names to layout net names after NCC completes and matches.
This allows one to probe networks in layout with the same name as in the schematics,
making it easier to compare schematic simulations against layout simulations.</LI>
<LI>"Use exemptedNets.txt file"
looks for the file 'exemptedNets.txt' in your library directory. This file specifies
nets that are exempted from simple parasitic extraction.  There are two ways these
nets are treated, depending on subsequent setting: if "Extract everything except
exempted nets" is selected, all networks are extracted except the ones in the
exempted nets file. If "Extract only exempted nets", only the nets in the exempted
nets file are extracted.  All nets connected to this net in subcircuits are also
treated the same way.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<!-- NEED 3in -->
Exempted Nets file format. One line per network. A network is specified by
a library name, cell name, and net name.  When nets are not extracted, a
lumped capacitance value may be specified to use on the network.  This last
argument is optional (0 if not specified) and ignored when the exempted nets
are the only nets extracted.
