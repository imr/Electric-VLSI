FastHenry is an inductance analysis tool (see the papers of <A HREF="http://rleweb.mit.edu/rlestaff/p-whit.htm">Jacob White</A>).
When a FastHenry deck is generated, a subset of the arcs in the current cell are written.
To include an arc in the FastHenry deck,
select it and use the <B>FastHenry Arc Properties...</B> command (in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Others)</B>).
<TABLE><TR><TD>
This command presents a dialog with FastHenry factors for the selected arc.
The most important factor is at the top: "Include this arc in FastHenry analysis".
By checking this, the arc is described in the FastHenry deck.
Once this is checked, other fields in the dialog become active.
You can set the thickness of this arc (the default value shown will be used if no override is specified).
You can set the number of subdivisions that will be used in height and width (again,
defaults are shown).
You can even set the height of the two ends of the arc.

<P>
Arcs can be partitioned into different groups.
Click the "New Group" button to define a group.
After that, arcs can be assigned to one or more groups.

After all arcs have been marked, generate a FastHenry deck with the <B>Write FastHenry Deck...</B>
command (in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Others)</B>).
Before doing that, however, you can set other options for FastHenry deck generation.
To do this, use the
FastHenry Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "FastHenry" tab).

This dialog allows you to set the type of frequency analysis
(single frequency or a sequence specified by a start, end, and number of runs per decade).
You can choose to use single or multiple-pole analysis
(and if multiple, you can specify the number of poles).
The FastHenry Preferences dialog also allows you to set defaults for the individual arcs that will be included in the deck.
You can specify the default thickness, and the default number of subdivisions (in height and width).
