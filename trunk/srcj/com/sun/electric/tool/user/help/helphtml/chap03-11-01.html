<!-- HEADER 3-11-1: Setting a Cell's View -->


<!-- COMMAND View/Change Cell's View... -->

Each cell has a <I>view</I>, which provides a description of its contents.
A view consists of a full name and an abbreviation to be used in cell naming.
For example, the "layout" view is abbreviated "lay" and so the layout view of cell "adder" is called "adder{lay}."
When no view name appears, the cell has the "unknown" view.
Possible views are:
<UL>
<LI>"layout" (for IC layout)
<LI>"schematic" (for logic designs)
<LI>"icon" (to describe a cell symbolically)
<LI>"layout.skeleton" (a minimal view)
<LI>"documentation" (a text-only view)
<LI>"VHDL" or "Verilog" (text-only views for hardware-description languages)
<LI>a number of "netlist" views
(text-only views that list connectivity for various tools such as "netlisp", "als", "quisc", "rsim", and "silos")
<LI>"unknown" (no specified view)
</UL>
<P>

When creating a cell with the <B>New Cell...</B> command,
you can specify its view.
After creation,
you can change the current cell's view with the <B>Change Cell's View...</B> command (in menu <B>View</B>).
You can also use context menus in the cell explorer to change a cell's view.
