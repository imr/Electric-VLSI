Multipage schematics are implemented in Electric
by having each page map to a different area of a vast schematic cell.
To create one of these multipage cells, use the <B>Make Cell Multi-Page</B> command
(in menu <B>Cell / Multi-Page Cells</B>).
You will then be editing page 1 of the multi-page schematic.
<P>
You can add pages to the current multipage schematic with the <B>Create New Page</B>
command (in menu <B>Cell / Multi-Page Cells</B>).
You can delete the current page with <B>Delete This Page</B>.
To advance to the next page, use <B>Edit Next Page</B>.
<P>
Older versions of Electric implemented multipage schematics with different view types ("p1", "p2", ...).
If these views appear instead of proper pages, use the <B>Convert old-style Multi-Page Schematics</B> command.
<P>
As a graphical aid to schematic design, frames can be displayed in a cell by using the <B>Cell Properties...</B>
command (in menu <B>Cell</B>).
Multi-page schematics require a cell frame on every page, but their presence is optional in other cells.
<P>

The frame size can be "Half-A", "A", "B", "C", "D",
and "E".
The frame can be horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait).
You can choose to display a title box in the lower-right corner.
The designer name can also be set for each cell.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Besides the designer name, cell frames have a company name and a project name.
These values are not set for each cell, but instead are preferences that
are set for each user.
Individual libraries can override these defaults as well.
<P>

<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
The Frame Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Frame" tab)
lets you set all of these defaults.
Note that the designer name is taken first from the cell,
then from the library if the cell does not set a value, and finally from the general default
if the library and cell do not set a value.
