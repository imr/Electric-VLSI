<!-- HEADER 9-11: Compaction -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/Compaction/Do Compaction -->

<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Compaction -->

The compaction tool squeezes layout down to minimal design-rule spacing.
It does this by doing single-axis compaction,
alternating horizontal and vertical directions until no further space can be found.
Each pass of compaction squeezes either to the left or to the bottom of the circuit.
<P>
To compact, use the <B>Do Compaction</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Compaction</B>).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
The Compaction Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Compaction" tab)
can tell the compactor to expand the circuit if it is too close for the design rules.
<P>
For an example of compaction, open the Samples library and edit the cell "tool-Compaction"
(you can read the library with the <B>Sample Cells</B> command, in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>).
<P>
Be warned that the compaction tool is experimental and doesn't always achieve optimal results.
