<!-- HEADER 2-1-3: Unusual Selection: Areas and Text -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Modes/Select/Select Area -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Modes/Select/Select Objects -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Selection/Enclosed Objects -->

Besides highlighting nodes and arcs, Electric can also highlight an arbitrary rectangular area.
The notion of a <I>highlighted area</I>, as opposed to a <I>highlighted object</I>,
is used in some commands, and it generally implies highlighting of everything in the area.
<P>
There are two ways to highlight an area.
If you click the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button where there is no object,
and hold it down while dragging over objects, all of those objects will be highlighted.
<P>

To more precisely define a highlighted area, switch to area selection (as opposed to object selection)
with the <B>Select Area</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Select</B>, or click on the "Area Selection" icon in the tool bar).
Use <B>Select Objects</B> to revert back to object selection.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Once in area selection mode, each click and drag of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button leaves the highlight rectangle on the screen exactly as it was drawn.
You can convert this selection to a set of actual nodes and arcs with the <B>Enclosed Objects</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
<P>
<H3>Selecting Text</H3>
<P>
<I>Highlighted text</I> appears as an "X" over the letters.
However, text is a special case, so it will not be covered until later
(<A HREF="chap06-08-02.html#chap06-08-02">Section 6-8-2</A>).
For now, if you highlight some text, it is best to click again and select something else.
