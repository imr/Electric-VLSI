<!-- HEADER 6-6: Replacing Circuitry -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Change... -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The <B>Change...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit</B>)
removes the currently highlighted node or arc and replaces it with a new one of a different type.
This same effect can be had by copying one object and then pasting it onto another
(see <A HREF="chap06-01.html#chap06-01">Section 6-1</A>).
A dialog is presented in which the possible replacements are shown.
For node changing, you can choose to show primitives from the current technology, cells from the current library, or both.

<P>
When replacing an arc, the existing nodes on either end must be able to reconnect to the new type of arc.
If "Change nodes with arcs" is checked, nodes will be changed to allow the new type of arc to remain connected.
<P>
When replacing a node, the existing arcs on it must be able to reconnect properly to the new node.
However, the sizes of the replaced object can be different, and the layout will be adjusted.
Electric determines which ports on the replaced node to use by examining the port names and locations.
If the ports are aligned correctly but not named the same, this matching will fail.
Check "Ignore port names" to disable name matching and use only position information.
If the new node is missing essential ports, such that existing wires cannot be reconnected,
then the change will fail (unless "Allow missing ports" is checked).
<P>
Besides replacing the currently highlighted node or arc ("Change selected ones only"),
it is also possible to specify replacement of many other objects.
<UL>
<LI>"Change all connected to this" requests that other objects of the same type which are connected to the highlighted ones will be changed.
<LI>"Change all in this cell" requests that all other objects of the same type in this cell will be changed.
<LI>"Change all in this library" requests that all other objects of the same type in the current library will be changed.
<LI>"Change all in all libraries" requests that all other objects of the same type in every library will be changed.
</UL>
<P>
This is a modeless dialog: it can remain up while other editing is being done.
Click "Done" to dismiss it, and "Apply" to make a change.
<P>
Note that some Schematic nodes use parameters to further describe them.
For example, an electrolytic capacitor is really just a capacitor with the "electrolytic" parameter on it.
Therefore, you can change a node into a capacitor, but not an electrolytic capacitor,
because it is not in the list.
To change a capacitor into an electrolytic capacitor, paste an electrolytic capacitor onto it.
Besides capacitors, parameters can be found on diodes, transistors,
sources, and two-ports (the four-connection primitives such as VCCS).
