Electric uses separate Java threads for all activities.
Because of this, if the system encounters an error, it aborts the thread but
the main program continues to run.
<P>
If a thread crashes and leaves a Job running, then you will not be able to
issue other commands, because their Jobs will be queued behind the stuck one
(see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A> for more viewing Jobs).
Even the <B>Quit</B> command is a job, and so it cannot run.
To solve this problem, use the <B>Force Quit (and Save)</B> command
(in menu <B>File</B>).
<P>
If you suspect that the database is corrupt, use the
 subcommands of the
<B>Check Libraries</B> command (in menu <B>File</B>).
The <B>Check</B> command examines the database but does not fix errors.
The <B>Repair</B> command checks and repairs the database (if it can).
<P>
The networks may also need to be renumbered.
Do this with <B>Redo Network Numbering</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Network</B>).
