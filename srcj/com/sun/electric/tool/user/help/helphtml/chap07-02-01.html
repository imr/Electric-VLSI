<!-- PROJECTSETTING Scale -->

Electric represents all distances in dimensionless units.
A transistor that is 2 x 3 in size is actually stored in memory as 2 x 3.
To convert these units to real distances, each technology has a <I>scale</I>,
measured in nanometers (billionths of a meter).
The scale of a technology is shown in the status area after the technology's name.
<P>
For example, if the scale for the MOSIS CMOS ("mocmos") technology is 200 nanometers,
then a 2 x 3 transistor is actually 400 x 600 nanometers (or 0.4 x 0.6 microns).
<P>

To set the scale, use the
Scale Project Settings (in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "Scale" tab).
<P>
Scale only applies to integrated-circuit layout technologies.
There is no scale for Schematics, Artwork, and other nonlayout technologies.
