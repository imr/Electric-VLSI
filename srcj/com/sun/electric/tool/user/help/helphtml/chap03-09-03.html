Writing libraries to disk is done with the <B>Save Library</B> command (in menu <B>File</B>).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig03-24.png" ALT="Figure 3.24"></CENTER></TD><TD>
The <B>Save All Libraries</B> command writes all libraries that have changed.
You can also use the save-libraries icon from the tool bar.
To force all libraries to be saved, use the <B>Mark All Libraries for Saving</B> command,
or use <B>Save All Libraries in Format...</B> to specify how they are to be saved.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
If a library was read from disk, it is written back to the same file.
If, however, you wish to write the library to a new file
(thus preserving the original) then use the <B>Save Library As...</B> command.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
The Library Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "Library" tab)
offers options for writing libraries to disk.
By default, saved libraries overwrite the previous files and no backup is created.
If you choose "Backup of last library file",
then the former library is renamed so that it has a "~" at the end.
If you choose "Backup history of library files",
then the former library is renamed so that it has its creation date as part of its name.

Electric can also write external format files with these commands in the <B>File / Export</B> menu:
<UL>
<LI><B>CIF (Caltech Intermediate Format)</B> is used to describe integrated circuit layout.
The output file contains only the current cell and any circuitry below that in the hierarchy.
Use the CIF Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "CIF" tab)
 to affect how CIF is written.
See <A HREF="chap07-03-02.html#chap07-03-02">Section 7-3-2</A> for more on CIF.
</LI>

<LI><B>GDS II (Stream)</B> is also used to describe integrated circuit layout.
The output file contains only the current cell and any circuitry below that in the hierarchy.
Use the GDS Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "GDS" tab)
 to affect how GDS is written.
See <A HREF="chap07-03-03.html#chap07-03-03">Section 7-3-3</A> for more on GDS.</LI>

<LI><B>EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format)</B> can write either the Netlist or the Schematic view of the circuit.
Electric writes EDIF version 2 0 0.
Use the EDIF Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "EDIF" tab) to affect how EDIF is written.
See <A HREF="chap07-03-04.html#chap07-03-04">Section 7-3-4</A> for more on EDIF.</LI>

<LI><B>LEF (Library Exchange Format)</B> is an interchange format that describes the exports on cells in a library.</LI>

<LI><B>L</B> is the GDT language, still appearing in some commercial systems.
The output file contains only the current cell and any circuitry below that in the hierarchy.</LI>

<LI><B>Eagle</B> is an interface to the Eagle schematics design system (its netlist format).
Before writing Eagle files, you must give every node the "ref_des" attribute, and every port on these nodes the "pin" attribute.
If you also place the "pkg_type" attribute on the node, it overrides the cell name.</LI>

<LI><B>ECAD</B> is an interface to the ECAD schematics design system (its netlist format).
Before writing ECAD files, you must give every node the "ref_des" attribute, and every port on these nodes the "pin" attribute.
If you also place the "pkg_type" attribute on the node, it overrides the cell name.</LI>

<LI><B>Pads</B> is an interface to the Pads schematics design system (its netlist format).
Before writing Pads files, you must give every node the "ref_des" attribute, and every port on these nodes the "pin" attribute.
If you also place the "pkg_type" attribute on the node, it overrides the cell name.</LI>

<LI><B>Text Cell Contents</B> is used to write a text file from a text cell.
The current window must be a textual view (such as VHDL, Verilog, documentation, etc.)
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text windows.</LI>

<LI><B>PostScript</B> is the Adobe printing language.
The output file contains only a visual representation of the current cell
(or part of that cell).
PostScript options can be controlled with the
Printing Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Printing" tab).</LI>

<LI><B>HPGL</B> is the Hewlett-Packard printing language.
The output file contains only a visual representation of the current cell
(or part of that cell).</LI>

<LI><B>PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</B> is an image format that captures the current window.</LI>

<LI><B>DXF (AutoCAD)</B> is a solid-modeling interchange format.
Use the DXF Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "I/O" section, "DXF" tab) to affect how DXF is written.
See <A HREF="chap07-03-07.html#chap07-03-07">Section 7-3-7</A> for more on DXF.</LI>

<LI><B>ELIB (Version 6)</B> writes old-format binary files.
These files can be read by version 6 of Electric.</LI>

<LI><B>JELIB (Version 8.03)</B> writes old-format JELIB files.
These files are useful for versions 8.03 and earlier.</LI>

The exported files from Electric are often considered to be proprietary information, and must be marked appropriately.
Copyright information can be inserted into exported files with the
Netlists Project Settings (in menu <B>File / Project Settings...</B>, "Netlists" tab).
Since each export file has a different format for comments, the copyright text should not contain any such characters.
Instead, the system will insert the proper comment characters for the particular export format.
<P>
The copyright information will be inserted into decks exported for CIF, LEF, and PostScript,
as well as in simulation netlists for
Verilog, Spice, Silos, ESIM/RSIM/RNL/COSMOS, FastHenry, Maxwell, and IRSIM.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Most netlisters insert date and version information in the comments at the head of the generated file.
You can request that this information be omitted by unchecking "Include date and version in output files".
<P>
Information about resistor ignoring can be found in <A HREF="chap07-05-01.html#chap07-05-01">Section 7-5-1</A>.
