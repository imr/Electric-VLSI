<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Silicon Compiler -->

Electric has a silicon compiler called QUISC
(the Queen's University Interactive Silicon Compiler).
It is a powerful tool that can do placement and routing of standard cells from a schematic or a structural VHDL description.
The VHDL is compiled into a netlist which is then used to drive placement and routing.
Schematics are first converted into VHDL, then compiled to a netlist and laid-out.
Thus, a byproduct of silicon compilation will be a {net.quisc} view of a cell, and potentially a {vhdl} view.
<P>
Be warned that the silicon compiler is rather old,
and so it produces layout that alternates standard cell rows and routing rows.
Modern silicon compilers use multiple metal processes to route over the standard cells,
but this system does not.
This system uses two layers: a <I>vertical</I> routing arc to run in and out of cells,
and a <I>horizontal</I> routing arc to run between the cells in the routing channel.
It also uses <I>power</I> arcs to bring power and ground to the cell rows,
and <I>main power</I> arcs to connect the rails on the left and right.
<P>
The VHDL description is normally placed in the "vhdl" view of a cell
(see <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing).
There is a VHDL example in cell "tool-SiliconCompiler{vhdl}" of the "samples" library.
To access it, use the <B>Sample Cells</B> command (in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>).
<P>
To convert a schematic or VHDL cell into layout, use the <B>Convert Current Cell to Layout</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Silicon Compiler</B>).
To compile VHDL to the {net.quisc} view, use the <B>Compile VHDL to Netlist View</B> command
(this is typically not needed, since the previous command does it automatically).
<P>
When creating a schematic or VHDL cell to be compiled,
it is important to know what primitives are available in the standard cell library.
Electric comes with a CMOS cell library in the MOSIS CMOS ("mocmos") technology.
This library is not correct, and exists only to illustrate the Silicon Compiler.
These component declarations are available:

The Silicon Compiler Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Silicon Compiler" tab)
let you control many aspects of placement and routing.

<LI>The "Layout" section controls the number of rows of cells that will be created.
A one-row circuit may be exceedingly wide and short, so you may wish to experiment with this value.
For a square circuit, the number of rows should be the square root of the number of instances in the circuit
(the number of instances appears as the sum of the unresolved references,
listed by the VHDL Compiler).</LI>
<LI>The "Arcs" section lets you set the horizontal and vertical routing arcs, as well as the power rails.</LI>
<LI>The "Well" section gives you the option of placing blocks of P-well and N-well over the cell rows.</LI>
<LI>The "Design Rules" section lets you control Via size, metal spacing, feed-through size,
port distance, and active distance.</LI>
