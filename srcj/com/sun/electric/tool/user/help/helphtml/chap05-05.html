<!-- HEADER 5-5: Default Arc Properties -->

<!-- PREFERENCE General/Arcs -->

The Arcs Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section,
"Arcs" tab) lets you control the arc creation process.
It does not affect existing arcs, only those that are subsequently created.
<P>
The top part of the dialog allows you to set defaults for specific types of arcs.
You select the "Technology" and "Arc Type", and then set defaults for it (such as the "Default width").
<P>
The "Placement angle" is the granularity for running this type of arc (in degrees).
A value of 90 lets arcs run at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees: manhattan geometry.
A value of 45 lets it run at any of 8 angles (useful for schematics).
A value of 0 lets it run at any angle (used in artwork).
<P>
The "Pin" is the node that gets used for connecting two of these arcs.
It is typically a "Pin" node (see <A HREF="chap07-01-01.html#chap07-01-01">Section 7-1-1</A>).
If changed to a node with geometry (such as a contact node) then these contacts will be placed
at the bends of this arc.
<P>
The checkboxes in the "Default State" section have these meanings:
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<UL>
<LI>Rigid - whether the arc is rigid in length and relationship to its nodes
(see <A HREF="chap05-02-01.html#chap05-02-01">Section 5-2-1</A>).</LI>

<LI>Fixed-angle - whether the arc stays at the same angle when one end moves
(see <A HREF="chap05-02-01.html#chap05-02-01">Section 5-2-1</A>).</LI>

<LI>Slidable - whether the arc slides around in its node's port
(see <A HREF="chap05-02-02.html#chap05-02-02">Section 5-2-2</A>).</LI>

<LI>Directional - whether the arc has an arrow drawn on it
(see <A HREF="chap05-04-01.html#chap05-04-01">Section 5-4-1</A>).</LI>

<LI>Ends extended - whether the arc extends past its endpoint by half its width
(see <A HREF="chap05-04-03.html#chap05-04-03">Section 5-4-3</A>).</LI>
</UL>
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig05-04.png" ALT="Figure 5.4"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The bottom portion of the dialog has controls for all arcs.
<UL>
<LI>"Play 'click' sounds when arcs are created" - plays a sound to confirm arc creation.
The sound is a single click for one arc, a double-click for two arcs,
and a triple-click for three or more arcs.</LI>
<LI>"Duplicate/Array/Paste increments arc names" -
sets whether the name on an arc should be kept unique by auto-incrementing
after this arc has been duplicated, arrayed, or pasted.</LI>
</UL>
