Once a selection is made, you can save it with the <B>Push Selection</B> command
(in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
The highlighting is not changed, but it is saved on a stack.
To restore this selection at a later time, use the <B>Pop Selection</B> command.

There are some selection preferences that can be set with Selection Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Selection" tab).
"Easy selection of cell instances" controls whether instances can be selected with simple clicks,
or whether they require extra effort to select
(see the <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">next section</A> for more).

<P>
The "Dragging must enclose entire object" requests that area-selection completely enclose an object in order to select it.
The default is that any object touching the area is selected.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
To prevent accidental moving of an object after selecting it,
object movement is disabled for a short time after the selection click.
This delay can be controlled.

<P>
When the cursor roams over a circuit, it shows a "preview" of what will be selected by the next click.
The advance preview is shown in a different color than the actual highlighting
(initially blue, but this can be changed with the Layers Preferences,
see <A HREF="chap04-06-02.html#chap04-06-02">Section 4-6-2</A>).
This feature is called "mouse-over highlighting".
If you do not want to see this preview, uncheck "Enable Mouse-over highlighting".
