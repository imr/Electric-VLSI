The <B>Open Library...</B> command (in menu <B>File</B>) brings a new library into Electric from disk.
These libraries may have the extension ".elib", ".jelib", or ".delib" (the jelib format is the default,
see <A HREF="chap10-01.html#chap10-01">Section 10-1</A>).

You can also use the open-library icon from the tool bar.

<P>
Electric users with very old ".elib" files may have difficulty reading them into Electric.
If you have been using versions of Electric prior to 7.00, it may help to upgrade to that version and read the libraries.
Saving ".elib" files from version 7.00 will work properly in the current system.
<P>
By default Electric searches for libraries in the working directory,
absolute file path references, and Electric's internal library directory.
Users can specify additional directories to search by using a file called
"LIBDIRS" placed in the working directory.
This file specifies additional paths to search for library files.
The file has the following syntax:
<P>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <i>&lt;comments&gt;</i><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include <i>&lt;another_LIBDIRS_file&gt;</i><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&lt;library_directory&gt;</i>
</code>
<P>
Paths may be absolute or relative.

Besides Electric libraries,
it is possible to read circuit descriptions that are in other formats with these commands in the <B>File / Import</B> menu:
<UL>
<LI><B>CIF (Caltech Intermediate Format)</B> is used to describe integrated circuit layout.
It contains no connectivity, so after the library is read, it does not know about transistors and contacts:
just layers.
You can use the node extractor to convert CIF to real Electric components
(see <A HREF="chap09-10-02.html#chap09-10-02">Section 9-10-2</A>).
To affect how CIF is read, use the CIF Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "CIF" tab).
See <A HREF="chap07-03-02.html#chap07-03-02">Section 7-3-2</A> for more on CIF.</LI>

<LI><B>GDS II (Stream)</B> is also used to describe integrated circuit layout.
It contains no connectivity, so after the library is read, it does not know about transistors and contacts: just layers.
You can use the node extractor to convert GDS to real Electric components
(see <A HREF="chap09-10-02.html#chap09-10-02">Section 9-10-2</A>).
To affect how GDS is read, use the GDS Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "GDS" tab).
See <A HREF="chap07-03-03.html#chap07-03-03">Section 7-3-3</A> for more on GDS.</LI>

<LI><B>EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format)</B> is used to describe both schematics and layout.
Electric reads EDIF version 2 0 0.
Use the EDIF Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "EDIF" tab) to affect how EDIF is read
(see <A HREF="chap07-03-04.html#chap07-03-04">Section 7-3-4</A>).</LI>

<LI><B>LEF (Library Exchange Format)</B> is an interchange format that describes the cells in a library.
The cells that are read in contain ports, but very little contents.</LI>

<LI><B>DEF (Design Exchange Format)</B> is an interchange format that describes the contents of a library.
DEF input often makes use of associated LEF files which must already have been read.
Use the DEF Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "DEF" tab) to affect how DEF is read
(see <A HREF="chap07-03-05.html#chap07-03-05">Section 7-3-5</A>).</LI>

<LI><B>DXF (AutoCAD)</B> is a solid-modeling interchange format, and so it may contain 3D objects that cannot be read into Electric.
Nevertheless, Electric creates a library of artwork primitives as well as it can.
Use the DXF Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "DXF" tab) to affect how DXF is read
(see <A HREF="chap07-03-07.html#chap07-03-07">Section 7-3-7</A>).</LI>

<LI><B>SUE (Schematic User Environment)</B> is a schematic editor that captures a single cell in each file.
The circuitry in SUE files is added to the current library instead of being placed in its own library
(because many SUE files may have to be read to build up a single Electric library).
Use the SUE Preferences (in menu File / Preferences..., "I/O" section, "SUE" tab) to affect how SUE is read
(see <A HREF="chap07-03-08.html#chap07-03-08">Section 7-3-8</A>).</LI>

<LI><B>ELIB</B> is an older Electric library format that is in an undocumented binary format.
</LI>

<LI><B>Readable Dump</B> is an older Electric library format that captures the entire database in a text-readable format.
These files were used when the ".elib" file was the main way of saving libraries, because a way was needed of reading
library files.
Now that the newer ".jelib" format is also text-readable, there is no need to use Readable Dumps anymore.</LI>

<LI><B>Text Cell Contents</B> is used to read a text file into a text cell.
The current window must be a textual view (such as VHDL, Verilog, documentation, etc.)

See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text windows.
