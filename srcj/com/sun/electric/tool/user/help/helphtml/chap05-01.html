<!-- HEADER 5-1: Introduction to Arcs -->

<TABLE><TR><TD>
The arcs in a circuit are much more than simple connecting wires.
They can take many different forms according to the needs of the design environment.
In schematics, arcs can be negated, directional, zig-zag, and more.
In layout, they can be directional and extended by half of their width.

<P>
The most important property of an arc is its ability to remain connected when physical changes are made to the circuit.
Constraining properties provide for intelligent circuit layout.

<P>
Electric allows you to control how layout changes when the circuit is modified.
This is done by placing <I>constraints</I> on the arcs that react to node changes.
Electric has a set of four constraints that, although not complete, have been
found to be useful in circuit design.
