A <I>library</I> is a collection of cells that forms a consistent hierarchy.
To enforce this consistency,
Electric stores an entire library in one disk file that is read or written at one time.
It is possible, however, to have multiple libraries in Electric.
Only one library is the current one, and this sometimes affects commands that work at the library level.
When there are multiple libraries, you can switch between them with the <B>Change Current Library...</B>
command (in menu <B>File</B>) or by using the library's context menu in the cell explorer
(see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).
To see which libraries are read in, use the <B>List Libraries</B> command.
<P>
To create a new, empty library, use the <B>New Library...</B> command (in menu <B>File</B>).
To change the name of the current library, use the <B>Rename Library...</B> command.
To delete a library, use the <B>Close Library</B> command.
This removes only the memory representation, not the disk file.
<P>
It is possible to link two libraries by placing an instance of a cell from one library into another
(this is done with the <B>Place Cell Instance...</B> command in menu <B>Cell</B>).
When this happens, the library with the instance
(the main library) is linked to the library with the actual cell (this is the <I>reference library</I>).
Because the reference library is needed to complete the main library,
it will be read whenever the main library is read.
<P>
If referenced libraries are edited independently,
it is possible that a reference to a cell in another library will not match the actual cell in that library.
When this happens, Electric creates a "placeholder" cell that matches the original specification.
Thus, the link to the referenced library is broken because the cell there does not fit where the instance should be.
To see a list of all placeholder cells that were created because of such problems,
use the <B>General Cell Lists...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>) and select "Only placeholder cells".

Electric comes with some built-in libraries:
<UL>
<LI>There are two Spice primitive libraries (see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).
</LI>
<LI>A library of examples can be loaded with the <B>Sample Cells</B> command (in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>).
Another simple library can be found in the <B>Load Library</B> command (in menu <B>Help / 3D Showcase</B>).
</LI>
<LI>A set of MOSIS CMOS pads can be loaded with the <B>MOSIS CMOS Pads</B> command (in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>).
</LI>
<LI>A set of cells used in the design of a MIPS processor (and used by the tutorial,
see <A HREF="chap01-12-01.html#chap01-12-01">Section 1-12-1</A>) is available with the
<B>MIPS Cells</B> command (in menu <B>Help / Load Built-in Libraries</B>).</LI>
<LI>A set of gates, useful for Logical Effort (see <A HREF="chap09-09.html#chap09-09">Section 9-9</A>),
can be loaded with the <B>Load Logical Effort Libraries (Purple, Red, and Orange)</B>
command (in menu <B>Tool / Logical Effort</B>).
</LI>
</UL>
Additional libraries are available at the Static Free Software website
(<A HREF="http://www.staticfreesoft.com">www.staticfreesoft.com</A>).
