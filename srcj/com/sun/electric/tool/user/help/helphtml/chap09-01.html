There are many different tools available in Electric for doing both synthesis and analysis of circuitry.
Synthesis tools include routers, compactors, circuit generators, and so on.
Analysis tools include design-rule checkers, network comparison, and many simulators.
To see a list of tools, including which ones are active,
use the <B>List Tools</B> command (in menu <B>Tool</B>).
This chapter covers many of the tools available in Electric.
<P>
When a tool is running, it may take a long time.
You can see it under the "JOBS" entry of the cell explorer
(see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).
After a tool has run, it may reports errors in the ERRORS section of the cell explorer.
To browse these errors, use the <B>Show Next Error</B> and <B>Show Previous Error</B> commands
(in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>) or type the "&gt;" and "&lt;" keys.
<P>
A number of common tool controls are available from the
General Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "General" tab),
especially in the "I/O" and "Jobs" section.

<P>
Most of the commands to generate an input deck for a simulator (a netlist) prompt the user for the desired file.
If "Show file-selection dialog before writing netlists" is unchecked, however, the file is written (or overwritten)
without prompt.
This is useful in repetitive iterations of design/simulate, and saves the cumbersome file-selection dialog.
However, it can be dangerous because it overwrites files without asking.
<P>
When reading and writing files, Electric remembers the last directory and uses it in subsequent
file selection dialogs.

<P>
Since different types of files are often stored in different locations,
the system remembers many different directories, organized by type.
Thus, there may be a current directory for "Database" work (library files),
for Spice simulation, etc.
Choose the type of file to examine and change the directory associated with it.
<P>
In the "Jobs" section,
"Beep after long jobs" requests that any job which runs longer than a minute make a beep sound when done.
The "Verbose mode" requests that all changes made by a job be described in the messages window.
<P>
You can set the maximum number of errors that will be reported at once.
By default, there is no limit to the number of errors.
<P>
For more information about "Maximum undo history", see <A HREF="chap06-07.html#chap06-07">Section 6-7</A>.
<P>
For more information about the "Memory" section, see <A HREF="chap01-03.html#chap01-03">Section 1-3</A>.
<P>
The "Database" section controls aspects of the Electric database that do not affect most users.
Electric can run as two processes: a client that manages the display and a server that manages the database.
By checking "Use Client / Server interactions", Electric will use this experimental configuration.
Checking "Snapshot Logging" requests debugging information on the client/server interactions.
