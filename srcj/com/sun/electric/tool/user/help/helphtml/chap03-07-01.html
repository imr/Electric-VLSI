<TABLE><TR><TD>
To get some basic information about the current cell
(size, dates, etc) use the <B>Describe this Cell</B> command
(in menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>).
<P>
To get information about more than one cell, use the <B>General Cell Lists...</B> command.
The dialog selects a subset of the cells in the current library.
<P>
The section labeled "Which cells:" selects the cells to be listed
(all, only those used in other cells,
only those NOT used in the current cell,
only those in the current cell,
or only "placeholder" cells: those created because of cross-library dependency failures,
see <A HREF="chap03-09-01.html#chap03-09-01">Section 3-9-1</A>).
<P>
The section labeled "View filter:" allows only certain views to be displayed.
<P>
The section labeled "Version filter:" allows removal of older or newer versions of cells.
<P>
The section labeled "Display ordering:" controls the order in which the selected cells will be listed.
<P>
The section labeled "Destination:" allows you to dump this listing to a disk file,
formatted for spreadsheets (tab-separated).

<P>
The last five columns show the usage and four state bits.
The usage is the number of times that this cell appears as an instance in other cells.
The state bits are:
<UL>
<LI>"L" if the cell contents are locked</LI>
<LI>"I" if instances in the cell are locked</LI>
<LI>"C" if the cell is part of a cell library</LI>
<LI>"D" if the cell has passed design-rule checking</LI>
</UL>
<P>
For more cell information, use the commands of menu <B>Cell / Cell Info</B>:
<UL>
<LI><B>List Nodes in this Cell</B> counts the number of nodes in current cell and below.
This is a hierarchical count: if two cell instances each have two transistors inside of them,
the total is 4 transistors.
However, it counts only actual nodes, ignoring arrayed nodes
(see <A HREF="chap06-09-03.html#chap06-09-03">Section 6-9-3</A>).
</LI>
<LI><B>List Cell Instances</B> shows all cell instances below the current cell.
</LI>
<LI><B>List Cell Usage</B> looks up the hierarchy and finds cells that contain the
current cell as an instance.
</LI>
<LI><B>Number of Transistors</B> counts the number of transistors in the current cell and below
(considering arrayed instances, see <A HREF="chap02-04-02.html#chap02-04-02">Section 2-4-2</A>).</LI>
