<!-- HEADER 6-8-1: Understanding Text -->

There are a number of ways to place text in a circuit.
<UL>
<LI>Each unexpanded instance of a cell has text that describes it, and its ports.</LI>
<LI>Each export has a text label.</LI>
<LI>Nodes and arcs can be named (with <B>Object Properties...</B>) so that they have text on them.
They can also have additional attributes that appear as text.</LI>
<LI>Certain primitive nodes (such as the Flip-Flop component of the Schematic technology)
have text as an integral part of their image.</LI>
<LI>It is even possible to create a special node that is only text
(with some of the commands under the "Misc" entry of the component menu:
"Annotation Text", "Spice Code", "Verilog Code", and "Verilog Declaration".</LI>
</UL>
Essentially, then, every piece of text on the display is tied to some node or arc.
By understanding the relationships between text and the attached objects,
it becomes easy to manipulate that text.
