Electric is a <I>noun/verb</I> system, meaning that all commands work by first selecting something (the noun)
and then doing an operation (the verb).
For this reason, selection is important.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-03.png" ALT="Figure 2.3"></CENTER></TD><TD>
Selection (and movement, wiring, and zooming) are done in "selection" mode, which is the default mode.
This mode is indicated by having the "selection" icon highlighted in the tool bar.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Selection is done with clicks of the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">left</A></I> button.
Individual nodes and arcs are selected by clicking over them.
You can tell in advance what will be selected by the button click, because the next object to be selected
is shown in blue.
This advance selection is called "mouse-over highlighting" and can be disabled
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-04.html#chap02-01-04">section 2-1-4</A>).
Once selected, objects are highlighted on the screen.
If you use the
<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">shift-left</A></I> button, unhighlighted nodes
and arcs are added to the selection, but objects that are already highlighted become deselected.
<P>
There are often multiple objects under the cursor (for example, in the area where an arc overlaps a node).
To get the object you want, hold the control key while clicking.
The <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">control-left</A></I> button cycles through all objects under the cursor.
<P>
The notion of toggling selection (shift-left) and cycling through what is under the cursor (control-left)
can be combined.
If there are multiple objects under the cursor,
 and you are trying to toggle the selection,
use the <I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08">control-shift-left</A></I> button to cycle through them
.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To select an object by its name, use the <B>Select Object...</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
The resulting dialog lets you select nodes, arcs, exports, or networks in the cell.
You can also search for objects by name (the search field supports regular expressions).
<P>
To select everything in the cell,
use the <B>Select All</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
To deselect everything, use <B>Select Nothing</B>.
<P>
To select everything in the cell that is the same as the currently selected objects,
use the <B>Select All Like This</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Selection</B>).
To loop through the objects similar to the selected one, use <B>Select Next Like This</B>
and <B>Select Previous Like This</B>.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-14.png" ALT="Figure 2.14"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The <B>Deselect All Arcs</B> command deselects all selected arcs.
This is useful when you wish to select a set of nodes,
but you have selected the entire area, including nodes and arcs.
