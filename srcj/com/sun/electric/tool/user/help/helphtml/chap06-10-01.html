For some primitive nodes, it is not enough to rotate, mirror, and scale.
These primitives can to be augmented with an <I>outline</I>,
which is a polygonal description.
<P>
There are quite a few primitive nodes that make use of outline information.
The MOS transistors use the outline to define the gate path in serpentine configurations
(see <A HREF="chap07-04-01.html#chap07-04-01">Section 7-4-1</A>).
The Artwork technology has nodes that use outline information:
Opened-Solid-Polygon, Opened-Dotted-Polygon, Opened-Dashed-Polygon,
Opened-Thicker-Polygon, Closed-Polygon, Filled-Polygon, and Spline
(see <A HREF="chap07-06-01.html#chap07-06-01">Section 7-6-1</A>).
<P>
For arbitrary shapes on arbitrary layers,
use the <I>pure-layer</I> nodes in the IC layout technologies.
The pure-layer nodes are found under the "Pure" entry in the component menu.
For example,
the node called "Metal-1-Node" in the CMOS technologies looks like a rectangle of the Metal-1,
until you add outline information.
With an outline, this node can take any shape.

<P>
Because pure-layer nodes are unusual, it is useful to be able to identify them.
Use the <B>Show Pure Layer Nodes</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Cleanup Cell</B>)
to highlight all of them in the current cell.
