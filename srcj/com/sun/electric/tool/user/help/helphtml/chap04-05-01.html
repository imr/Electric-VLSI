<!-- HEADER 4-5-1: The Component Menu -->
<!-- PREFERENCE Display/Component Menu -->

<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
The component menu shows the nodes and arcs of the current technology.
The popup menu at the top lets you change the current technology and see its nodes and arcs.
<P>
In the component menu, nodes have a blue outline and arcs have a red outline.
To place a node in the current cell, click on its entry and then click again in the cell to place the node.
If you type "," or "." before clicking to place the node, then the rotation of the placed node changes.
To select a default arc for wiring, click on its entry (note that the default arc has a heavier red outline).
<P>
Some node entries in the component menu have multiple nodes in them, as indicated by a black arrow
in the lower-right corner.
Clicking on the arrow shows a menu of possible nodes to create.
Once selected, that node becomes the default for the menu entry.
<P>
Special component menu entries with text in them are provided for special functions:
<UL>
<LI>"Pure" places pure-layer nodes (see <A HREF="chap06-10-01.html#chap06-10-01">Section 6-10-1</A>).</LI>

The layout of the component menu is controlled by the Component Menu Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Display" section, "Component Menu" tab).
The menu is shown on the left, and the possible entries (Nodes, Arcs, Cells, and Special) are on the right.
To change a menu entry, select it (the selected entry is highlighted in green),
and choose either "Remove" to empty that entry or "&lt;&lt; Add" to add the selected Node,
Arc, Cell, or Special to the entry.
Adding multiple nodes to a menu entry allows that entry to have a popup menu to select among the nodes.
