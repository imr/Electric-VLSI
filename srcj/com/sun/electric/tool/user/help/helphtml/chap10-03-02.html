<!-- HEADER 10-3-2: Node Instances -->

Inside of a cell definition, node instances are declared with the "N" and "I" lines.
"N" is for primitive nodes and "I" is for cell instances.
All nodes are sorted by the node name.
The syntax is:
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="90%">
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><B>N&lt;type&gt; | &lt;name&gt; | &lt;nameTD&gt; | &lt;x&gt; | &lt;y&gt; | &lt;width&gt; |

<TR><TD WIDTH="20%">&lt;type&gt;</TD><TD WIDTH="80%">the type of the node instance.
For primitive node instances, this has the form: [&lt;technology&gt;:]&lt;primitive-node&gt;.
If &lt;technology&gt; is omitted, the technology of the cell is assumed.
For cell instances, it has the form: [&lt;library&gt;:]&lt;cell&gt;;&lt;version&gt;{&lt;view&gt;}.
If &lt;library&gt; is omitted, the library defined by this JELIB file is assumed.</TD></TR>

<P>
The &lt;orientation&gt; field consists of any of the following letters, with an optional numeric part at the end:
<P>
"X"	if the node instance is X-mirrored (mirrored about Y axis).<BR>
"Y"	if the node instance is Y-mirrored (mirrored about X axis).<BR>
"R"	each letter rotates the node instance at 90 degrees counter-clockwise.<BR>
Num	Any digits at the end are additional rotation in tenths of a degree.	
<P>
The &lt;flags&gt; field consists of any of the following letters, sorted alphabetically, with the numeric part at the end:
<P>
"A"	if the node instance is hard-to-select.<BR>
"L"	if the node instance is locked.<BR>
"V"	if the node instance is visible only inside the cell.<BR>
Num	Any digits at the end are the technology-specific bits.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Nschematic:Transistor|mos@0||2|0|4|4|R|2|ATTR_length(D5G0.5;X-0.5;Y-1;)S2</CODE>
<P>
Places a schematic Transistor called "mos@0" at (2,0), size 4x4, rotated 90 degrees.
The flag field "2" is numeric, and therefore is technology-specific information
(in this case, it makes the transistor be pMOS).
There is one attribute on the node, called "length", with the value "2" (a string).
This attribute is displayed, anchored at its center ("D5"),
is 1 half grid unit in size ("G0.5;"), and is offset (-0.5, -1) from the node center ("X-0.5;Y-1;").
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Ilow;1{lay}|HAPPY||14|12|Y|A|D5G4;</CODE>
<P>
Places an instance of cell "low{lay}" from the library defined in this JELIB file.
The instance is named "HAPPY".
It is at (14,12),mirrored in Y, and is rotated 0.
The "A" means that the node is hard-to-select.
Its name is described by D5G4;
 (D5 means a centered anchor point, G4; means size 4 units).
