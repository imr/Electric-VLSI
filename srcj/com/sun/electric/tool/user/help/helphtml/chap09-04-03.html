Electric can produce input decks for Spice simulation with the <B>Write Spice Deck...</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Spice)</B>).
Since there are may formats of Spice output, you must first set the "Spice Engine" field of the
Spice Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Spice" tab).
After the Spice deck has been written, you must run Spice externally to produce a simulation output file.
Note that the Electric distribution does not come with a Spice simulator: you must obtain it separately.
<P>
After Spice has finished running, use the <B>Plot Simulation Output, Guess File</B>
command (in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Spice)</B>) to read the Spice output and plot the waveforms.
If the file cannot be guessed from the cell name, you can use <B>Plot Simulation Output, Choose File...</B>,
to select the desired Spice output file.
The Spice simulation information is shown in a waveform window
(see <A HREF="chap04-11.html#chap04-11">Section 4-11</A> for more).
<P>
<H4>Special Spice Nodes</H4>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
There are many powerful facilities for running Spice with Electric.
The example shown here illustrates some of these facilities.
This example is available in the Samples library as cell "tool-SimulateSpice"
(you can read the library with the <B>Load Sample Cells Library</B> command, in menu <B>Help</B>).
<P>
All input values to Spice are controlled with special nodes,
found in the "Spice" component menu entry.
Note that the first time any Spice node is placed, the library of Spice parts is loaded into Electric,
so there may be a delay.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-30.png" ALT="Figure 9.30"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The Spice nodes described here are Electric's default set.
However, additional sets can (and have) been written.
To choose another set, use the
Spice Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Spice" tab).
Under the setting "Spice primitive set", choose another set.
A second set of nodes, called "SpicePartsS3", is tailored towards special Spice3.

In this example, there is a 5-volt supply on the left.
It was created by using the "DC Voltage" entry under "Spice" entry of the component menu.
Once placed, the text that reads "Voltage=0V" can be selected and modified
(either with <B>Object Properties...</B> or by double-clicking on it).
The Pulse input signal on the right is created with the "Pulse" entry under "Spice" (it has 7 parameters).
<P>
There are both voltage and current sources, in AC and DC form.
There is a piecewise-linear (PWL) source, and two pulses (voltage and current).
A set of "two-gate" devices are also available: "CCCS", "CCVS", "VCCS", "VCVS",
and "Transmission".
<P>
It is possible to specify Transient, DC, or AC analysis by using the "Transient Analysis",
"DC Analysis", and "AC Analysis" subcommands.
The "Probe" lets you graphically specify signals of interest to Spice.
Only one such element may exist in a circuit.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
For advanced users, there are two special Spice nodes: "Node Set" and "Extension".
The Node Set may be parameterized with an arbitrary piece of Spice code.
Truly advanced users may create their own Spice nodes by modifying the cells in the Spice library
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-04.html#chap09-04-04">next Section</A>).
<P>
<H4>Spice Text</H4>
<P>
This example also shows the ability to add arbitrary text to the Spice deck, as shown in the lower-right.
To create this text, use the "Spice Code" or "Spice Declaration" entries under the "Misc." button in the component menu.
These command create text that can be modified arbitrarily.
Whatever the text says will be added to the Spice deck (declarations go near the top).
<P>
Another option that can be used when modeling transistors and other component is to set a specific Spice model to use for that component.
To set a node's model, select it and use the <B>Set Spice Model...</B> command (in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Spice)</B>).
<P>
The <B>Add Multiplier</B> subcommand places a multiplier on the currently selected node.
Multipliers (also called "M" factors) scale the size of transistors inside of them.
<P>
Another piece of text that can be added to a circuit is for separate flattened analysis files.
This is useful for Nanosim timing assertions, hierarchical measurements, etc.
The <B>Add Flat Code</B> subcommand places a piece of text in the circuit that will be flattened
and written to a separate file with the "flatcode" extension.
Flattening adds global scope to these statements.
For example, if you place a Nanosim timing assertion in a cell with the flat code
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold $(clk) rf $(in) rf 100p 100p</CODE><BR>
and there are 3 instances of the cell, then there will be 3 flattened assertions in the flatcode file:
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold xtop.xflop1.clk rf xtop.flop1.in rf 100p 100p<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold xtop.xflop2.clk rf xtop.flop2.in rf 100p 100p<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold xtop.xflop3.clk rf xtop.flop3.in rf 100p 100p</CODE><BR>
If <CODE>clk</CODE> is actually a single signal that comes from the top level, it is smart enough to recognize this:
<BR><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold clk rf xtop.flop1.in rf 100p 100p<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold clk rf xtop.flop2.in rf 100p 100p<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tv_node_setuphold clk rf xtop.flop3.in rf 100p 100p</CODE><BR>

The top part of this dialog allows you to control Spice deck generation:
<UL>
<LI><B>Spice engine</B> Can be Spice 2, Spice 3, HSpice, PSpice, Spice Opus, Gnucap, or SmartSpice.</LI>
<LI><B>Spice level</B> Can be 1, 2, or 3 (not used anymore).</LI>
<LI><B>Resistor shorting</B> Specifies which resistors get shorted when writing a Spice netlist from a schematic.
Choices are:
  <UL>
  <LI>"none" no resistors are shorted.
  This preserves all resistors (useful for simulations).</LI>
  <LI>"normal only" only normal schematic resistors are shorted.
  This is useful when running external LVS tools like Calibre and Assura against a Spice netlist because
  it shorts out parasitic resistors (such as from wire models)
  but preserves poly resistors which are actual devices in the layout.</LI>
  <LI>"normal and poly" both normal and poly schematic resistors are shorted.
  This is available only because the Verilog netlister uses the same netlisting subsystem;
  it is unlikely that you will want this setting for Spice netlisting.</LI>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Parasitics</B> Controls the writing of parasitics in the Spice deck.
Choices are:
  <UL>
  <LI>"Trans area/perim only" which writes the area and perimeter of transistor active but
does not write any Resistor/Capacitor information.</LI>
  <LI>"Conservative RC" writes Resistor/Capacitor information (in addition to the area/perimeter).</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI><B>Globals</B> Has three options for the treatment of global signals (such as power and ground):
  <UL>
  <LI>"No special treatment" causes globals to be treated like other signals.</LI>
  <LI>"Use .GLOBAL block" places global signals in a .GLOBAL block (not supported by all versions of Spice).</LI>
  <LI>"Create .SUBCKT ports" causes globals to be added to .SUBCKT headers as explicit ports.
      Note that this preference should be used when Global Partitions are in use
      (see <A HREF="chap06-09-05.html#chap06-09-05">Section 6-9-5</A>).</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI><B>Spice primitive set</B> Switches between Spice primitive sets.
Currently there are only two: "spiceparts" and "spicepartsG3".</LI>
<LI><B>Write VDD/GND in top cell</B> Whether to write power and ground signals in the top-level cell.</LI>
<LI><B>Use cell parameters</B> When set, any parameters defined on the cell will appear in the Spice deck.
When not checked, each parameterized cell appears multiple times in the deck,
once for each different parameter combination.
See <A HREF="chap06-08-05.html#chap06-08-05">Section 6-8-5</A> for more on parameters.
<LI><B>Write trans sizes in units</B> Requests that the Spice deck contain scalable size information
instead of absolute size information.</LI>
<LI><B>Write .subckt for top cell</B> Requests that a the top-level cell be written
as a subcircuit, and a call made to it.
The default is to write the top-level cell without a subcircuit wrapper.</LI>
<LI><B>Write .end statement</B> Requests that an .end statement be written at the end of the deck.
This can be disabled in situations where the deck is part of a larger Spice deck.</LI>
<LI><B>Use Header cards from files with extension</B>
specifies that header cards (placed at the start of the Spice deck)
can be found in a file with the cell's name and the given extension.</LI>
<LI><B>Use Header cards from file</B> lets you specify the file with header cards.</LI>
<LI><B>No Header cards</B> prevents any header cards from being written to the Spice deck.</LI>
<LI><B>Use Trailer cards from files with extension</B>
specifies that trailer cards (placed at the end of the Spice deck)
can be found in a file with the cell's name and the given extension.</LI>
<LI><B>Use Trailer cards from file</B> lets you specify the file with trailer cards.</LI>
<LI><B>No Trailer cards</B> prevents any trailer cards from being written to the Spice deck.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Note that the header and trailer information is specific to a particular technology.
If you set this information for one technology, but then use another technology when generating the Spice deck,
the information that you set will not be used.
Note also that schematics, although a technology in Electric, are not considered to be Spice technology.
You can set the proper layout technology that you want to use when dealing with schematics by using the
"Layout technology to use for schematics" popup.
This popup can be found in the
Technology Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Technology" tab,
see <A HREF="chap07-01-02.html#chap07-01-02">Section 7-1-2</A>).
<P>
The bottom part of the dialog controls how Spice can be run after a deck has been written:
<UL>
<LI><B>After writing deck</B> Electric can create an external process as specified by the user to
run Spice on the generated netlist.
If the pull-down box is set to "Don't Run", nothing is done.
If the pull-down box is set to "Run, Ignore Output", the external process is run,
and the user is notified when it is finished.
If set to "Run, Report Output", a dialog box is opened to show the user the output produced by the process.
Please note that this is a <I>process</I>, and not a command line command.
For example, <CODE>echo blah &gt; file</CODE> will NOT work.
Encapsulate it in a script if you want to do such things.</LI>
<LI><B>Run program</B> Identifies the Spice program to run.</LI>
<LI><B>With args</B> the arguments passed to the program.</LI>
<LI><B>Use dir</B> if specified, this is the working directory of the program.</LI>
<LI><B>Overwrite existing file (no prompts)</B> this will overwrite the existing netlist without prompting the user.</LI>
<LI><B>Run probe</B> this will run the waveform viewer on the output of the Spice run.</LI>
<LI><B>Help</B> tells which environment variables are exported to be used by the process.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The following variables are available to use in the program name and arguments:
<UL>
<LI><B>${WORKING_DIR}</B> The current working directory.</LI>
<LI><B>${USE_DIR}</B> The Use Dir field, if specified (otherwise defaults to WORKING_DIR).</LI>
<LI><B>${FILENAME}</B> The output file name (with extension).</LI>
<LI><B>${FILENAME_NO_EXT}</B> The output file name (without extension).</LI>
<LI><B>${FILEPATH}</B> The full path to the output file.</LI>
</UL>

Another set of controls can be used is the Spice Model Files Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Spice Model Files" tab).
This dialog allows you to specify a disk file of Spice cards that will be used to describe any cell.
Instead of the cell subcircuit, the specified disk file is "included" in the deck.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig09-11.png" ALT="Figure 9.11"></CENTER>
<P>
The same function can be done by using the <B>Set Netlist Cell From File</B> command
(in menu <B>Tools / Simulation (Spice)</B>).
This places a piece of text in the cell, which you must edit to be the path to a disk file.
That file will then be included in the Spice deck instead of the actual subcircuit of the cell.
