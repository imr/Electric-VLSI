In a busy circuit, many objects may overlap, causing confusion when selecting.
To simplify selection, objects can be marked so that they are no longer <I>easy-to-select</I>,
which means that standard selection does not work on them.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-16.png" ALT="Figure 2.16"></CENTER></TD><TD>
To select hard-to-select objects,
use the <B>Toggle Special Select</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Modes / Select</B>).
You can also click on the "Special Select" tool bar button to enable "special selection".
Once in this mode, all objects are selectable.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
Ease of selection extends to more than just nodes and arcs.
There are four "classes" of objects that can be selected:
<UL>
<LI>Basic objects (all arcs, primitive nodes, and port names)
<LI>Cell instances
<LI>Node and arc text (names and other text placed on nodes and arcs)
<LI>Instance names (an unexpanded cell instance's name)
</UL>
By default, the first three classes are easy-to-select, and instance names are hard-to-select.
If you uncheck "Easy selection of cell instances" in the Selection Preferences dialog,
then cell instances become hard-to-select.
<P>
Although all nodes and arcs are typically easy-to-select,
you can control them individually by unchecking the "Easy to Select" field in their properties dialog
(use the <B>Object Properties...</B> command in menu <B>Edit / Properties</B>).
If multiple objects are selected, the <B>Object Properties...</B> dialog has a popup on the right for changing their selection difficulty.
<P>
Special commands exist in the <B>Selection</B> menu for dealing with easy-to-select nodes and arcs.
You can select all of the easy-to-select objects in the current cell with the <B>Select All Easy</B> command.
Similarly, you can select those that are not easy-to-select with the <B>Select All Hard</B> command.
To change the ease of selection for a set of objects,
highlight them and use either <B>Make Selected Easy</B> or <B>Make Selected Hard</B>.
