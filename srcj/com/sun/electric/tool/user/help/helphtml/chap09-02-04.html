<!-- HEADER 9-2-4: Coverage Rules -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/DRC/Check Area Coverage -->
<!-- COMMAND Tool/DRC/List Layer Coverage on Cell -->
<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Coverage -->

Some foundries request that each layer occupy a minimum percentage of the chip.
To enforce such rules, additional pieces of geometry must be placed around the chip to fill that layer.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
To check for proper minimum layer coverage, use the <B>Check Area Coverage</B> command
(in menu <B>Tool / DRC</B>).
To control the coverage rules, use the Coverage Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Coverage" tab).
Each layer in the technology has a minimum percentage of coverage that is needed.
<P>
The coverage check proceeds in a "tiled" manner, checking rectangular areas of the cell.
For example, to check each 100x100 unit area of the cell, set "Width" and "Height" to 100,
and set "DeltaX" and "DeltaY" to 100.

<P>
The <B>List Layer Coverage on Cell</B> command is another way to compute the percentage of the cell that is covered by each layer.
This command examines the entire cell without breaking it into tiled rectangles.
<P>
Use the <B>Fill (MoCMOS)...</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Generation</B>) to automatically generating fill
(see <A HREF="chap09-08-02.html#chap09-08-02">Section 9-8-2</A>).
