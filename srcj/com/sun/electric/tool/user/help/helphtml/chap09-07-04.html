<P>
For certain situations, NCC cannot figure out that two cells are
equivalent unless the designer supplies extra information. The
designer supplies this information by adding NCC annotations to
layout and/or schematic cells.
This is done with the subcommands of the <B>Tools / NCC / Add NCC Annotations to Cell</B> menu.
</p>
<p>
NCC annotations are represented by
attributes placed on cells.
The attribute's name is <i>NCC</i> and it contains one or more lines of text, each with a separate NCC annotation.
Thus, although a cell can have at most one attribute named <i>NCC</i>,
that attribute can contain any number of NCC annotations.
</p>

<H4>exportsConnectedByParent <i>&lt;string or regular expression&gt;</i></H4>
<P>
Layout cells sometimes contain multiple exports that are supposed to
be connected by the parent cell.
For example, a layout cell might export "vdd", "vdd_1", "vdd_2", and "vdd3".
The designer expects that instances of this cell will connect all the vdd exports to a single network.
However, because the corresponding schematic cell usually only contains a single export,
"vdd", the NCC of the schematic and layout cells fails.
This situation is most common for the power
and ground networks, although it occasionally arises for signal
networks such as <i>clock</i> or <i>precharge</i>.
</p>
<P>
The <B>Exports Connected by Parent vdd</B> and <B>Exports Connected by Parent gnd</B> commands
create this annotation which tells NCC which exports will be connected by the parent.
The keyword is followed by a list of strings and/or regular expressions
(regular expressions must begin and end with a '/').
For example:
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
exportsConnectedByParent vdd vdd_1 vdd_2<BR>
exportsConnectedByParent vdd /vdd_[0-9]+/
</p>
<p>
When NCC compares a cell with an <i>exportsConnectedByParent</i>
annotation it performs the comparison as if those exports were connected.
It is safe for NCC to believe this annotation because NCC also checks the assertion.
When NCC encounters an instance of a cell
with an <i>exportsConnectedByParent</i> annotation it reports an
error if that assertion isn't satisfied.
</p>

<H4>exportsToIgnore <i>&lt;exportNames&gt;</i></H4>
<p>
This annotation, created with the <b>Exports To Ignore</b> command,
tells NCC to ignore certain exports in the cell.
At the next level up, the equivalent ports on instance of the cell are also ignored,
so the network connected to that port does not see the port or the instance.
If the port is further exported up the hierarchy, the new export needs to be ignored and another
<i>exportsToIgnore</i> annotation is required.
</p>
<p>
The <i>exportNames</i> field can be a set of names or a regular expression (surrounded by "/").
</p>
<p>
The annotation works only on the current cell (not any associated cells in the same cell group).
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a layout cell has extra exports: "E1" and "E2" which do not exist in the schematic.
This can happen when there are exports on dummy polysilicon.
In the layout cell, add the annotation <i>exportsToIgnore E1 E2</i>.
This will ignore the extra layout cells, and it will also ignore the use of these exports,
higher up the hierarchy.
</p>

<H4>skipNCC <i>&lt;comment&gt;</i></H4>
<p>
The skipNCC annotation should be added to a cell when:
<ul>
<li>Its schematic and layout won't pass either flat or hierarchical NCC and</li>
<li>You want a hierarchical NCC of the cell's parent to flatten the cell.</li>
</ul>
If a cell has a skipNCC annotation, then a hierarchical comparison
won't check it and will flatten through that cell's level of hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
A common reason for needing this annotation is the unfortunate situation in which
the exports of the schematic and the layout don't match.
A <i>skipNCC</i> prevents NCC from reporting export mismatches because
1) The cell is not checked by itself and
2) When a parent of the cell is checked, the cell's exports are
discarded because NCC flattens through the cell.
Although not always possible, it's better to fix export mismatches, because fixing them
will yield clearer mismatch diagnostics when there is a problem.
</p>
<p>
All the characters following the keyword to the end of the line serve as a comment.
This is useful for documenting why this annotation was necessary.
When you ask NCC to compare every cell in the design,
NCC will tell you which cells it is skipping and why.
For example, if a cell includes the NCC annotation: 
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
skipNCC layout is missing ground connection
</p>
<p>
then NCC will print:
</p>
<p style=padding-left:10px>
Skipping NCC of A because layout is missing ground connection. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>skipNCC</i> annotation is created by the <B>Skip NCC</B> command and may be placed on any schematic
or layout cell in the cell group.
In general, it is preferable to place the annotation on the schematic cell
because it's more visible to the designer.
</p>

<H4>flattenInstances <i>&lt;string or regular expression&gt;</i> ...</H4>
<P>
Hierarchical NCCs do not require a perfect match between the schematic and layout hierarchies.
Instead, hierarchical NCC uses heuristics to determine which cell instances must be flattened
and which can be compared hierarchically.
The heuristic sometimes make mistakes.
When that happens, the <i>flattenInstances</i> annotation can guide the heuristic.
</p>
<p>
The list of strings and/or regular expressions are used to match instance names within the cell.
Those cell instances that match are always flattened.  
</p>

<H4>notSubcircuit <i>&lt;comment&gt;</i></H4>
<P>
The designer should add the <i>notSubcircuit</i> annotation to a cell if:
<ul>
<li>The schematic and layout will pass NCC when compared separately but</li>
<li>Hierarchical NCC of a parent of the cell should not treat the cell as a hierarchical
element but should, instead, flatten it.</li>
</ul>
One reason for using this annotation is to correct errors made by the
heuristic that determines which cells to flatten and which to compare hierarchically.
For example, suppose that the schematic instantiates
cell B{sch} 1000 times and the layout instantiates cell B{lay} 500 times.
In principle one could use the <i>flattenInstances</i>
annotation to inform NCC which instances to keep and which to flatten.
However sometimes that's more work than it's worth and it's
better to add a single <i>notSubcircuit</i> annotation to cell B{sch}
or B{lay} to tell NCC to never treat the cell as a hierarchical entity.
</p>
<p>
When hierarchical NCC encounters a <i>notSubcircuit</i> annotation it prints
a message that includes the comment in a manner similar to <i>skipNCC</i>.
</p>
<p>
The notSubcircuit annotation only affects hierarchical NCC; it is
ignored by flat NCC. 
</p>
<p>
The <i>notSubcircuit</i> annotation is created by the <B>Not a Subcircuit</B>
command and may be placed on any schematic or layout cell in the cell group.
In general, it is preferable to place the annotation on the schematic cell
because it's more visible to the designer.
</p>

<H4>joinGroup <i>&lt;cell name&gt;</i></H4>
<p>
Memberships in cell groups is important when NCC performs
hierarchical comparisons because NCC assumes that cells in the same
cell group are supposed to be topologically equivalent.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally it is impractical to place the layout and schematic views
of a cell in the same cell group.
For example when layout is automatically generated from hand drawn schematics it may be better to
place the layout in a different library than the schematics.
</p>
<p>
The designer should use the <B>Join Group</B> command to add a <i>joinGroup</i> annotation to a cell if NCC
should behave as if that cell belongs to a different cell group (which may be in a different library).
The cell group to move the cell to is
the cell group that contains the cell named in the annotation.
That specification should be fully qualified: "library:cell{view}".
</p>

<H4>transistorType<i>&lt;type&gt;</i></H4>
<p>
This annotation, created with the <B>Transistor Type</B> command, changes the nature of transistors in the cell.
This is rarely used anymore but was once important when there were fewer known transistor types.
The <i>type</i> field may be one of the following: 
N-Transistor, VTH-N-Transistor,
VTL-N-Transistor, OD18-N-Transistor, OD25-N-Transistor,
OD33-N-Transistor, NT-N-Transistor, NT-OD18-N-Transistor, 
NT-OD25-N-Transistor, NT-OD33-N-Transistor, P-Transistor,
VTH-P-Transistor, VTL-P-Transistor, OD18-P-Transistor,
OD25-P-Transistor, or OD33-P-Transistor.
</p>

<H4>resistorType<i>&lt;type&gt;</i></H4> 
<p>
This annotation, created with the <B>Resistor Type</B> command,
changes the nature of all polysilicon resistors in the cell.
The <i>type</i> field may be one of the following: 
N-Poly-RPO-Resistor, N-Poly-RPO-Resistor,
P-Poly-RPO-Resistor, or P-Poly-RPO-Resistor.
Unlike all other resistors, polysilicon resistors are <i>not</i> treated as short circuits by NCC.
Instead, NCC tries to match these schematic polysilicon resistors with layout polysilicon resistors.
</p>
<p>
Warning: This annotation is used <i>very</i> infrequently.
Typically it is used only inside special libraries such as the "red" library
(see <A HREF="chap09-09.html#chap09-09">Section 9-9</A>).
Most designers simply instantiate resistors from those special libraries.
</p>

<H4>forcePartMatch <i>&lt;partName&gt;</i></H4> 
<p>
This annotation, created with the <b>Force Part Match</b> command,
forces nodes with the given name in the schematic and layout to be associated.
This annotation is useful when local partitioning
fails to detect a mismatch but hash code partitioning does.
In that case <i>forceWireMatch</i> can be used to tell NCC that certain node were
intended to match.
With luck, a strategically placed <i>forcePartMatch</i> can cause NCC
to display fewer hash code mismatches and help the user narrow in on the actual error.
</p>
<p>
After fixing the problem, you should try to 
remove all <i>forcePartMatch</i> annotations. 
</p>

<H4>forceWireMatch <i>&lt;wireName&gt;</i></H4> 
<p>
Same as <i>forcePartMatch</i> except that this command works on wires rather than nodes.
</p>

<H4>blackBox <i>&lt;comment&gt;</i></H4> 
<p>
This annotation, placed with the <b>Black Box</b> command, tells NCC to ignore the cells in this cell group
and assume they are topologically equivalent.
This annotation is useful when a particular arrangement of layout 
geometry implements a construct that Electric doesn't understand.
For example, to handle resistors and parasitic bipolar transistors in the layout.
</p>
<p>
The <i>blackBox</i> annotation should be used with care because,
unlike the other annotations, NCC has no way of double checking
the assertion to insure that it is correct.
</p>
<p>
The blackBox annotation may be placed on any schematic
or layout cell in the cell group.
In general, it is preferable to place the annotation on the schematic cell
because it's more visible to the designer.
