<!-- HEADER 5-4-5: Curvature -->

<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Curve through Cursor -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Curve about Cursor -->
<!-- COMMAND Edit/Arc/Remove Curvature -->

An unusual arc property, used only in circular geometry, is curvature.
Although most arcs cannot handle curvature, those in the Artwork and Round CMOS ("rcmos")
technologies can.

The <B>Curve through Cursor</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Arc</B>)
requests that the currently highlighted arc curve in such a way that it passes through the location of the cursor.
The <B>Curve about Cursor</B>
command requests that the currently highlighted arc curve between its endpoints
such that the center of curvature is at the location of the cursor.
After issuing these commands, click and drag to see how the arc will curve.

<P>
The <B>Remove Curvature</B> command makes the arc straight.
