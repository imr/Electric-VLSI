<!-- HEADER 7-6-3: The Generic Technology -->

One particularly interesting technology is the Generic technology,
which is a grab bag of miscellaneous facilities.
It is not necessary to actually switch into this technology,
for all of its nodes and arcs are available through other means.
<P>
<H3>Special Arcs</H3>
<P>
The <I>Universal arc</I> in the Generic technology is able to make a connection between any two components,
even if they are in different technologies.
This is useful when mixing technologies while still maintaining proper connectivity,
for example when simulating.
<P>
The <I>Invisible arc</I> attaches any two components, but makes no electrical connection.
It is useful for constraining otherwise unrelated components.
<P>
The <I>Unrouted arc</I> makes arbitrary electrical connections,
like the universal arc, but routers know to replace them with real geometry.
<P>
None of these arcs produce any actual geometry in IC descriptions,
but they make important conceptual connections.
Any existing arc in a normal technology can be converted to one of these three special arcs by using the <B>Change...</B>
command (in menu <B>Edit</B>).
<P>
<H3>Special Nodes</H3>
<P>
There are also special nodes in the Generic technology.
They are all available from the "Misc." entry of the component menu.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Cell Center</I>, defines the origin of any cell.
Once the node is placed, its location is at (0,0) for the cell.
Since instances of the current cell use the origin as the <I>anchor point</I> for cursor-based references,
the location of this node defines the anchor.
For example, if you place this node in the upper-right corner of a cell,
then creation commands place instances such that their upper-right corner is at the cursor.
See <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A> for more information on cell centers.
<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Essential Bounds</I>, defines an alternate boundary of any cell.
At least two of them must be placed in opposite corners, although 4 can be place to make it look better.
<P>
Note that the Cell Center and Essential Bounds nodes are made "hard-to-select" by default,
which means that they can be selected only by using "Special Select" mode
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-05.html#chap02-01-05">Section 2-1-5</A> for more).
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="fig02-17.png" ALT="Figure 2.17"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The <I>Spice Code</I> and <I>Spice Declaration</I> entries create text for Spice decks
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-03.html#chap09-04-03">Section 9-4-3</A>).
The <I>Verilog Code</I> and <I>Verilog Declaration</I> entries create text for Verilog decks
(see <A HREF="chap09-04-02.html#chap09-04-02">Section 9-4-2</A>).
These entries actually create Universal Pin nodes with appropriate text on them.
<P>
A special primitive, called <I>Simulation Probe</I> is recognized by simulators and visually modified to reflect
whatever it is connected to.
The simulators that reflect the state of the circuit by drawing lines along arcs also fill-in these probe nodes.
It provides a visual display of simulation activity, and works especially well with the
VCR controls in the waveform window.
See <A HREF="chap04-12-01.html#chap04-12-01">Section 4-12-1</A> for more.
<P>
The <I>DRC Exclusion</I> node is used by the design-rule checker
(see <A HREF="chap09-02-03.html#chap09-02-03">Section 9-2-3</A>).
The <I>AFG Exclusion</I> node is used by the auto-fill generator
(see <A HREF="chap09-08-02.html#chap09-08-02">Section 9-8-2</A>).
<P>
The <I>Invisible Pin</I> is used for holding text,
and it does not appear in hardcopy output
(this is what is created when you use place Annotation Text).
This pin can connect to any arc.
<P>
The <I>Universal Pin</I> is a node that can connect to any arc.
This is useful as an intermediate component when replacing
(first you replace the unwanted node with a Universal-Pin to allow it to fit with the existing arcs;
then you replace the arcs; finally you put the desired new node in place).
<P>
The <I>Unrouted Pin</I> is used when joining unrouted arcs.
It can also connect to anything.
