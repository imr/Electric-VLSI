<!-- HEADER 10-3-1: Cells -->

After the header information, each cell is described.
A cell consists of a cell declaration ("C") followed by a number of node ("N"), instance ("I"),
arc ("A"), and export ("E") lines.
The cell is terminated with a cell-end line ("X").
Inside of a cell, all nodes come first and are sorted by the node name; arcs come next and are sorted by the arc name;
finally come exports, sorted by the export name.
Also, when there are multiple cells, their appearance in the file is sorted by the cell name.
The syntax is:

<TR><TD>&lt;group&gt;</TD><TD>the name of this cell's group (if different than expected).

<P>
The Java format for dates (the creation and revision dates) is in milliseconds
since the "epoch" (Midnight on January 1, 1970, GMT).
<P>
The &lt;flags&gt; field consists of any of the following letters, (sorted alphabetically):
<P>
"C"	if this cell is part of a cell-library.<BR>
"E"	if the cell should be created "expanded".<BR>
"I"	if instances in the cell are locked.<BR>
"L"	if everything in the cell is locked.<BR>
"T"	if this cell is part of a technology-library.
<P>
Example:
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>CrxArray;1{lay}||mocmos|1092185029000|1092185060000|I</CODE>
<P>
Declares cell "rxArray{lay}", version 1, associated with the "mocmos" technology.
The cell was created at date 1092185029000 and last modified at date 1092185060000.
All instances in the cell are locked.
