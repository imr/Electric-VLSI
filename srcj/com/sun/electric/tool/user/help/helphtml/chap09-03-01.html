<!-- HEADER 9-3-1: Well and Substrate Checking -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/ERC/Check Wells -->

<!-- PREFERENCE Tools/Well Check -->

To check the well and substrate layers, use the <B>Check Wells</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / ERC</B>
).
This does a more thorough job of checking the layers than the design-rule checker.
<P>
After analysis is done, you can review the errors by typing "&gt;" to see the next error and "&lt;" to see the previous error.
You can also see the list of errors in the cell explorer
(see <A HREF="chap04-08.html#chap04-08">Section 4-8</A>).
<P>
You can control the Well Checker with the Well Check Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Well Check" tab).

<P>
The Well Checker makes sure that there are well contacts in every area of well.
The dialog allows you to relax that restriction and demand only 1 well contact in each cell,
or not to check for contacts at all.
<P>
The Well Checker also checks that there is a connection to power and ground in the appropriate places.
You can disable these checks in the "Well Check" dialog.
<P>
An additional well check is to find the farthest distance from a substrate contact to the edge of that area.
This check takes more time to do, and so it can be disabled.
<P>
The Well Checker can check spacing rules between well areas.
Although this is generally the domain of the Design Rule Checker (DRC), it can be requested here by checking
"Check DRC Spacing Rules for Wells".
Since the well checker has not been designed for DRC purposes,
the algorithm is not efficient and therefore the option is off by default.
<P>
Finally, the Well Checker reports the maximum distance from a well contact to any point on the well.
This is useful when making sure that there are sufficient contacts for each area.
