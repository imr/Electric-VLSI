<!-- HEADER 3-8: Rearranging Cell Hierarchy -->

<!-- COMMAND Cell/Package Into Cell... -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/One Level Down -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/All the Way -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/Specified Amount... -->

In order to manipulate hierarchical circuits,
it is useful to create and delete levels of the hierarchy.
The <B>Package Into Cell...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>)
collects all of the highlighted objects into a new cell.
You will be prompted for the cell name.
To package everything in an area, use the Area Selection commands
(see <A HREF="chap02-01-03.html#chap02-01-03">Section 2-1-3</A>).
When packaging an area, every node touching the area and all arcs between nodes in the area
are included in the new cell.
<P>
Packaging does not affect the highlighted circuitry.
However, after packaging circuitry into a new cell,
that circuitry can be deleted and replaced with an instance of the cell.
<P>
The opposite function is the removal of levels of hierarchy.
This is done with the <B>Extract Cell Instance</B> subcommands (in menu <B>Cell</B>),
which takes the currently highlighted cell instances and replaces them with their contents.
The <B>One Level Down</B> subcommand just replaces the selected instances with their contents.
The <B>All the Way</B> subcommand continues to extract instances inside of instances until there are
no more instances, just primitives.
The <B>Specified Amount...</B> prompts for a number of levels of hierarchy and extracts that many levels deep.
All arcs that were connected to the cell instances are reconnected to the correct parts of the instantiated circuitry.
