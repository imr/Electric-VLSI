The default width is set by the Arcs Preferences (in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "General" section, "Arcs" tab).
If there are other arcs of this type already connected to the new one,
and they are wider than normal, then the new arc will use that width.
<P>
Note that all arcs overlap their endpoint by half of their width,
so very wide arcs may overlap their destination with too much geometry.
You can turn off this overlap by using the <B>Toggle End Extension of Head</B> and
<B>Toggle End Extension of Tail</B> commands (in menu <B>Edit / Arc</B>).
See <A HREF="chap05-04-03.html#chap05-04-03">Section 5-4-3</A> for more on end extension.

An unusual circuit creation command is the <B>Insert Jog In Arc</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Arc</B>).
This command inserts a jog in the highlighted arc by replacing it with three new arcs.
Two of the new arcs run to the location of the cursor,
and the third arc is perpendicular to them, connecting the ends at the cursor location
(initially it has zero length).

<P>
Once the jog is inserted, either half of the arc may be moved without affecting the other half,
and the perpendicular arc will keep the circuit connected.
<P>
Beginning users often leave many extra pins in their circuits.
With the <B>Cleanup Pins</B> command (in menu <B>Edit / Cleanup Cell</B>),
these pins are automatically removed from your circuit, leaving a cleaner network.
The command does other pin organizations, such as making sure that text on these pins is located correctly,
identifying zero-sized pins, and identifying oversized pins.
The <B>Cleanup Pins Everywhere</B> command does this function for all cells at once.
